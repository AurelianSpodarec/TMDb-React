# Date Movie

A React App that uses the [TheMovieDB.org](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) API.

## Motivation
Hobby project aimed at perfecting every part of code and optimize it.

Ultimatelly, I've also created the project to showcase my skill as most projects I work on are in private repos - thus giving a better understanding where my skill is at. You can also check a pre-beta no-code tool I'm building here: [TailBuilder](https://app.tailbuilder.com/) 

# Installing the project

### `npm install` 

Installs required packages.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

### `npm run preview`

Once the app is built, you might run the preview command.

The vite preview command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at http://localhost:4173. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
